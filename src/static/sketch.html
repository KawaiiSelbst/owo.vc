    Unfortunately, the sketchy link generator has been taken offline. I no
    longer have control over the IP address that the service previously used,
    and without it I don't personally feel that the sketchy links are
    particularly unique.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, as this was a server that was of interst to some, I've provided a
    decoder before for any links that may have been previously generated.
