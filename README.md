# owo.vc
owo.vc is a simple link obfuscator that allows users to easily and quickly
create links that can mask or owoify the destination links metadata. It also
allows users to proxy metadata if they would simply like to count the number of
scrapes and clicks that their link has received.

owo.vc provides several methods of obfuscating links, including a zero-width
shortener. All methods allow for looking up the statics of a link at a later
date.

The current version of this source code is running at [owo.vc](https://owo.vc/)
and is free for the public to use. An API for programmatic usage is also
available, with simple documentation available [here](https://owo.vc/api.html).
